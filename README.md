### Performance Tracking

#### Database Tables Created

1. **trades** - Complete trade history
2. **model_performance** - Model metrics over time
3. **parameter_optimization** - Parameter changes and improvements

#### Accessing Performance Data

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

# Connect to database
conn = sqlite3.connect('data/performance_history.db')

# View recent trades
trades = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM trades ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10', conn)

# Check win rate over time
win_rate = pd.read_sql('''
    SELECT DATE(timestamp) as date,
           AVG(CASE WHEN profit_pct > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as win_rate
    FROM trades
    GROUP BY date
    ORDER BY date DESC
''', conn)
```

### Configuration Options

#### Enable/Disable Features

```json
{
  "ml": {
    "adaptive_learning": true,  // Master switch
    ...
  },
  "adaptive_learning": {
    "enabled": true,
    "parameter_optimization": {
      "enabled": true,         // Parameter tuning
      "interval_hours": 12
    },
    "signal_weight_adjustment": {
      "enabled": true,          // Weight adaptation
      "interval_hours": 4,
      "adaptation_speed": 0.1   // 10% per adjustment
    }
  }
}
```

#### Performance Thresholds

```json
"performance_thresholds": {
  "trigger_optimization": 0.55,  // Win rate to trigger optimization
  "trigger_retraining": 0.60,    // Accuracy to trigger retraining
  "minimum_sharpe": 0.5,         // Minimum Sharpe ratio
  "maximum_drawdown": 0.20       // Maximum acceptable drawdown
}
```

### Learning Events

The system triggers immediate learning when:

- **Large Win** (>5% profit) - Increases confidence
- **Large Loss** (>3% loss) - Reduces risk multiplier
- **Pattern Detection** - New profitable patterns found
- **Performance Degradation** - Win rate drops below threshold

### Expected Improvements

#### Week 1-2: Initial Learning

- System identifies best trading hours
- Filters out low-probability setups
- Adjusts to market volatility

#### Week 3-4: Pattern Recognition

- Identifies winning signal combinations
- Optimizes entry/exit timing
- Improves risk management

#### Month 2+: Advanced Adaptation

- Market regime detection
- Seasonal pattern recognition
- Cross-pair correlation learning

### Troubleshooting Adaptive Learning

#### Issue: Models not retraining

```bash
# Check if scheduler is running
grep "Starting continuous learning thread" logs/*.log

# Manually trigger retraining
python -c "from ai.adaptive_learning_manager import AdaptiveLearningManager; manager = AdaptiveLearningManager(config, None, None, None); manager.retrain_models()"
```

#### Issue: Weights not updating

```bash
# Check weights file
cat config/adaptive_weights.json

# Check minimum trades requirement (default: 50)
sqlite3 data/performance_history.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trades;"
```

#### Issue: No performance improvement

```python
# Increase adaptation rate (default: 0.1)
"adaptation_rate": 0.2  # 20% adaptation

# Decrease retraining interval
"retrain_interval_hours": 12  # Every 12 hours instead of 24

# Expand parameter ranges
"rsi_oversold": {"min": 15, "max": 45, "step": 5}
```

### Key Performance Indicators

1. **Win Rate Trend** - Should improve over time
2. **Average Profit per Trade** - Should stabilize or increase
3. **Sharpe Ratio** - Should increase as system learns
4. **Maximum Drawdown** - Should decrease with better risk management

### SQL Queries for Analysis

```sql
-- Weekly performance trend
SELECT
    strftime('%W', timestamp) as week,
    AVG(profit_pct) as avg_profit,
    COUNT(*) as total_trades,
    AVG(CASE WHEN profit_pct > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as win_rate
FROM trades
GROUP BY week
ORDER BY week DESC;

-- Best performing signal combinations
SELECT
    ROUND(ml_score, 1) as ml_range,
    ROUND(technical_score, 1) as tech_range,
    AVG(profit_pct) as avg_profit,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM trades
GROUP BY ml_range, tech_range
HAVING count > 5
ORDER BY avg_profit DESC;
```

### Advanced Features

#### Custom Learning Rules

Add your own learning rules in `adaptive_learning_manager.py`:

```python
def custom_learning_rule(self, trade_data):
    """Add custom learning logic"""
    # Example: Reduce risk after consecutive losses
    if self.consecutive_losses >= 3:
        self.adaptive_params['risk_multiplier'] *= 0.9

    # Example: Increase confidence after consecutive wins
    if self.consecutive_wins >= 5:
        self.adaptive_params['risk_multiplier'] = min(1.5,
            self.adaptive_params['risk_multiplier'] * 1.1)
}
```

#### Export Learning Data

```python
# Export performance for external analysis
def export_learning_data():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('data/performance_history.db')

    # Export all tables to CSV
    for table in ['trades', 'model_performance', 'parameter_optimization']:
        df = pd.read_sql(f'SELECT * FROM {table}', conn)
        df.to_csv(f'exports/{table}.csv', index=False)

    conn.close()
```

3. **Compile the EA:**
   - Press `F7` on your keyboard, or click the **Compile** button (green play triangle icon)
   - Wait for compilation to complete
   - Check the **Toolbox** window at the bottom for messages

4. **Verify Success:**
   - Look for "Compilation successful" in green text
   - You should see `FX-Ai_Connector.ex5` created in the same folder as your `.mq5` file
   - If there are errors, they will be shown in red in the Toolbox

##### Method B: Using Command Line (Alternative)

```batch
# Navigate to your MT5 MetaEditor directory (usually):
cd "C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 5\metaeditor64.exe"

# Compile the EA:
metaeditor64.exe /compile:"C:\Users\andyc\python\FX-Ai\mt5_ea\FX-Ai_Connector.mq5" /log
```

#### Install the Compiled EA in MT5

##### Method A: Automated Installation (Recommended)

1. Run `install_ea.bat` as Administrator
2. The script will automatically:
   - Detect your MT5 installations
   - Allow you to select which MT5 to use (if multiple)
   - Copy the compiled `FX-Ai_Connector.ex5` to the correct Experts folder
   - Create a backup if the EA already exists
   - Optionally create a desktop shortcut to MT5

##### Method B: Manual Installation

1. **Open MetaTrader 5**
2. **Go to Data Folder:**
   - Click `File` → `Open Data Folder`
   - This opens Windows Explorer to your MT5 data directory

3. **Navigate to Experts Folder:**
   - Go to `MQL5\Experts\`
   - Copy `FX-Ai_Connector.ex5` from your `mt5_ea\` folder to this location

4. **Refresh MT5:**
   - Back in MT5, open the **Navigator** panel (Ctrl+N)
   - Right-click on "Expert Advisors" and select "Refresh"
   - You should now see "FX-Ai_Connector" in the list

#### Attach EA to Chart

1. **Find the EA:**
   - In Navigator panel, expand "Expert Advisors"
   - Locate "FX-Ai_Connector"

2. **Attach to Chart:**
   - Drag the EA onto any chart (preferably EURUSD H1 timeframe)
   - Or right-click the EA → "Attach to Chart"

3. **Configure Settings:**
   - **Common Tab:**
     - ✅ Allow automated trading
     - ✅ Allow DLL imports (if needed)
     - ✅ Allow import of external experts
   - **Inputs Tab:**
     - Set your Magic Number (default: 20241028)
     - Configure Lot Size (default: 0.01)
     - Set Max Spread (default: 30)
     - Configure Risk Management settings
     - Set Signal File name (default: fxai_signals.txt)
     - Enable/Disable Auto Trading as needed

4. **Start Trading:**
   - Click "OK" to attach the EA
   - The EA will show as a smiley face icon on the chart
   - Green smiley = EA running normally
   - Yellow/Red smiley = Check the Experts tab for messages

```json
{
  "mt5": {
    "login": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER",
    "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD",
    "server": "YOUR_BROKER_SERVER"
  },
  "trading": {
    "symbols": ["EURUSD", "GBPUSD"],
    "risk_per_trade": 50.0,
    "max_positions": 5
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Test Connection

```bash
python mt5_diagnostic.py
```

This comprehensive diagnostic tool will test:

- MT5 module import
- MT5 terminal connection
- Account access and permissions
- Symbol availability
- Market data retrieval
- Historical data access
- File system permissions for MT5-EA communication

### 5️⃣ Start Trading

- **FXAi_TimeSync.csv** - Time synchronization data (handled internally by Python clock sync)

### Trading Workflow

1. **EA monitors market data** and exports to CSV files
2. **Python reads data**, performs analysis using:
   - Technical indicators (VWAP, EMA, RSI, ATR)
   - Support/Resistance levels
   - Volume analysis
   - Fundamental data from web sources
   - ML predictions
3. **Python writes signals** to fxai_signals.txt
4. **EA reads signals** and executes trades
5. **Position management**:
   - Stop loss/Take profit
   - Breakeven adjustments
   - Trailing stops
   - Day trading closure

## Troubleshooting Setup Issues

### EA Not Loading

- Check Expert Advisors are enabled in MT5
- Verify AutoTrading is ON
- Check the Experts tab for errors
- Try running `install_ea.bat` again as Administrator
- If EA file issues, run `fix_ea_files.bat` first to organize files

- **"Signal file not found"**: Check MT5 file permissions

### Communication Issues

- Ensure MT5 and Python are using the same file directory
- Check Windows permissions for file access
- Run `python mt5_diagnostic.py` for detailed diagnostics

### Trading Not Executing

- Verify market is open
- Check spread is within limits
- Ensure sufficient margin
- Verify symbol names match your broker

## Quick Test

1. Run `FX-Ai_Start.bat` to set up the environment and start the system
2. Configure your MT5 credentials in `config/config.json`
3. Run `python mt5_diagnostic.py` to test MT5 connection
4. Run `python main.py` to start the trading system
5. Check `logs\` folder for system logs (format: fxai_YYYY-MM-DD.log)
6. Monitor system performance and active positions

## Clock Synchronization

The FX-Ai system maintains accurate time synchronization between:

- **Local System Time** - Your computer clock
- **NTP Network Time** - Synchronized with internet time servers
- **MT5 Server Time** - Broker platform time

### Features

- **Automatic NTP Sync**: Connects to reliable NTP servers (pool.ntp.org, time.google.com, etc.)
- **MT5 Time Validation**: Cross-checks with MT5 server time for accuracy
- **Background Monitoring**: Continuous time drift monitoring every 5 minutes
- **Drift Detection**: Alerts when time drift exceeds 1 second threshold
- **Fallback System**: Uses best available time source (NTP > MT5 > Local)

### Synchronization Status

The system automatically starts time synchronization when FX-Ai begins and runs continuously in the background. Time accuracy is critical for:

- Precise trade timing
- Signal execution timing
- Historical data alignment
- Multi-timeframe analysis

### Manual Time Check

You can force a time synchronization check by accessing the clock synchronizer through the main application logs, which will show sync status and any drift warnings.
