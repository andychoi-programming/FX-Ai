RECOMMENDATION
--------------
Use Weekend Version for:
- Comprehensive parameter discovery
- Final production optimization
- When you have 2+ hours available
- Initial setup and periodic re-optimization

Both versions maintain the same quality features (MT5 time, hard close,
breakeven, trailing stops) - the difference is coverage depth.
